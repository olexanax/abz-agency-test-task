# Dear abz.agency

This test task was interesting and enjoyable to complete, thank you for that

Stack:
- React + TypeScript
- SASS + sass.modules 
- RTK query + query-string (for requests and to work with API)
- Ract Hook Form (to work with form)
- ZOD (to work with form validation)
- framer-motion  (to add some animation for best user experience)
- sonner (toast lib for displaying errors)

In general, the project has the following structure:
src folder:
- components (all interface components are here)
- images (images here)
- lib (utilities, helpers, validators, project wrappers here)
- reduxFolder (all API requests and logic here)
- styles (general styles here)

list of completed items:
- Working with mockups ( HTML/CSS).
- Working with REST API (GET).
- Working with REST API (POST)
- Website optimization:
   1.Image optimization (converting to webp format)
   2.Checked my work using Google Page Speed
   3.Checked my work using Lighthouse


All the requirements and tasks in the test assignment have been completed in full. I also added animations and replaced the spinner with Skeleton when displaying content loading
Validation when creating a user is equal to validation from the API. When working with styles, I used the mobile-first pattern

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
